# **Exercise 1: Warm-Up - Bypassing a Simple Login Prompt 🔓**

Welcome to your first **Arduino exploitation exercise**! This is a **warm-up challenge** designed to help you get comfortable with **basic vulnerability exploitation**.  

## **🔧 What You Need**  
- **An Arduino board** (Uno, Mega, or similar).  
- **A USB cable** to connect the Arduino to your computer.  
- **Arduino IDE** (or an equivalent tool) to compile and flash the firmware.  

This exercise runs on **any Arduino** and requires only a **computer with a USB connection**.

## **📌 What You Should Do**
1. **Clone the repository** to get the exercise files:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dcland/Silicon-Surgery.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the exercise directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Exercise1
   ```
3. **Open the `.ino` file** in your Arduino IDE.  
4. **Build and flash** the firmware onto your Arduino board.  
5. **Open the Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE to communicate with the device.  
6. Once you see the **login prompt**, you can start hacking!

## **🚀 Exercise Steps**  
Once the prompt is up, complete the following challenges:  

### **1️⃣ Bypass the Login Without Knowing the Password**  
- Use **any vulnerability you can find** to gain access.  
- Ensure that **after bypassing the prompt, the stack is in a correct state** and the system remains stable.  

### **2️⃣ Find the Hidden Password**  
- Analyze the firmware behavior to **extract or manipulate the password**.  
- Consider various **information leaks** or **brute-force techniques**.  

### **3️⃣ Control the System: Turn on the Built-in LED**  
- Once you’ve bypassed the login and found the password, **use existing system functions** to turn on the built-in LED.
