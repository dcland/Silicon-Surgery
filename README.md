# **Arduino Exploit Lab 🚀🔬**

Welcome to **Arduino Exploit Lab**, a hands-on workshop designed to teach **hardware security, firmware exploitation, and reverse engineering** using real-world vulnerabilities in Arduino-based systems.

## 🔍 **What’s Inside?**
This repository contains **small, standalone exercises** that demonstrate different security weaknesses in embedded systems. Each exercise includes:  
- **A vulnerable firmware** (`.ino` file) ready to be compiled and flashed onto your Arduino.  
- **A Python exploit script** that demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited.  
- **A short explanation** guiding you through the attack, including where to start and what to look for.  
- **Reverse engineering challenges** to help you analyze firmware, understand how it works, and uncover hidden weaknesses.

## 🎯 **How to Get Started?**
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Pick an exercise and flash the provided `.ino` firmware onto your Arduino.  
3. Follow the explanation and use the corresponding Python script to exploit it.  
4. Try the **reverse engineering challenges** to dig deeper into firmware internals.  
5. Learn, break, and have fun! 🔥  

## 🛠 **What You’ll Need?**
- An **Arduino board** (Uno, Mega, or similar).  
- **Arduino IDE** or PlatformIO to compile and flash the firmware.  
- **Python 3** to run the exploits.  
- (Optional) **Firmware analysis tools** for the reverse engineering challenges.

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
This project is for **educational purposes only**. It is intended to teach ethical hacking, vulnerability research, and embedded security.  
**Do not use these techniques for malicious purposes.**
